## Managing At Scale

Managing a single resource with PowerShell is just the tip of the iceberg. With its incredible versatility and automation capabilities, PowerShell empowers administrators to scale their management efforts to handle tens or hundreds and thousands of resources effortlessly. It doesn't matter if you need to manage an Active Directory user account, a Hyper-V virtual machine, or a directory of files. If you can do it for one thing, you can just as easily do it for 10, 100, or 1000 things. In this session, we will explore how PowerShell enables you to manage resources at scale efficiently, demonstrating the power of the PowerShell pipeline. We'll also look at new features in PowerShell 7.
